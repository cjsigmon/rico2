Goyco School stands tall with vibrant teal walls and gates that welcome an entire community. When the school closed in 2015, wife and husband Mariana Reyes and Tito Matos had a vision to continue holding classes and offering a safe space to grow — but in a slightly less traditional way.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For years, the duo dedicated themselves to community activism and cultural advocacy for the island of Puerto Rico. Through music, conversations and love, the two were able to build up La Goyco, a community center that serves as an anchor while creating a haven for Puerto Rican culture, the health of the greater island and a sustainable environment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in January 2022, Matos unexpectedly died of a heart attack at age 53.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a world-renowned legend in la plena — Puerto Rico’s unique Latin American and African musical style — whose fierce energy was loved by many, his death not only struck his family and friends, but an entire musical community.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"replace-video\" id=\"com-vid\">Video loading&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/29/arts/music/hector-tito-matos-dead.html\">Matos&#8217; obituary</a> published by the New York Times, Ed Morales, a journalist, author and friend of Mr. Matos described him as “super, super gregarious and charismatic.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the year following his death, Reyes has continued to raise their nine-year-old son Marcelo. Simultaneously, she directs the entire community center and continues to build up the physical space that they had once dreamed of together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, La Goyco continues to nurture three pillars of focus: culture, health and environment. This can be found in the conversations held in the community garden or seen while children play on the playground pieces made from repurposed materials.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On some weeknights, the rhythm of la plena music dances through the corridors of the center and fills the humid evening air of Puerto Rico. On other days, theater performances and cinema screenings are shared in the outdoor area that was once considered the center of the schoolyard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The people of La Goyco have worked throughout the past seven years to continue rebuilding the school and shaping the future of the island. The team of individuals who created La Goyco began to make progress only months after the school initially closed, beginning with a presentation of their ideas to the municipality. To gain access to the land, they would have to receive the local government’s approval while giving continuous updates throughout the process.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image

After the presentation, they began moving in and getting things done, even though they had not been granted formal permission yet.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We didn&#8217;t do it behind their backs, but we didn&#8217;t wait for them to give us permission either,” Reyes said. “So it was a combination of strategies — on the one side, we&#8217;re talking to them all the time and keep keeping them informed. And on the other side, we&#8217;re just going to do whatever needs to be done.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Work continued to be done. They installed solar panels and held community meetings as conversations continued between the activists and the municipality. And in August 2020, they received the deed to the land.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, the school has a team of 100 volunteers and a handful of paid employees organizing events and serving as leaders of the Santurce community. One of these leaders is Johanna Dominguez, who serves as the coordinator of the community quality of life program at La Goyco.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><div

Goyco.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>She attended the Pedro G. Goyco School in the late 1990s as a child, and returned years later because of her desire to be a part of the movement that reclaimed her elementary school. She started as a volunteer who cleaned throughout the restoration process, delivered groceries during the pandemic and searched for resources to continue growing the center. Now, her role focuses on the well-being of the community, which includes welcoming visitors, helping lead therapy sessions and any other tasks that benefit the greater good of the culture.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Being able to win this school, and they grant us the ownership of this school was good for our community because we still have a little bit of our essence and of what this neighborhood once was, and it is also a symbol of resistance and struggle,” she said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This resistance that she consistently talks about through her work is captured through the ongoing events and opportunities for all ages that are hosted through the center. The leaders of La Goyco hope to create a community on the island that lasts as a legacy and will be able to address ongoing issues with climate, government and well-being for the next generation of Puerto Rican youth.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This is what I want for my kid,” Reyes said. “He believes this is life — a place where people are building stuff and working together and doing beautiful things and being supportive to one another. He believes this is the world because this is his world.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for other children on the island, community centers might not be as accessible. And in the past 10 years, neither has an education.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over 800 schools have closed on the island in the last 10 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Children across the island have grappled with the deadly Hurricane Maria, unstable power systems, economic crisis and the pandemic. When the disasters struck, necessities such as healthcare and electricity were much harder to attain, leaving many Puerto Ricans with no choice but to leave the island. When they left, their children left — leaving numerous vacant seats in the classrooms and not enough money in the bank for the school to stay open.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When one of these schools shuts down, students are reassigned to another nearby school — effective immediately in many circumstances. Some students have left one class on Friday afternoon and walked into a completely different school on Monday.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some schools on the island that shut down are sold to buyers who intend to privatize the school, others become hotels or living spaces. Many sit vacant for years, with the last date they were open written on the top corner of the whiteboard.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"replace-pop\"> interactive loading . . . </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While there are fewer children on the island than several decades ago, many Puerto Ricans feel that the closures of the schools reinforce the idea that young people are not a priority to the island.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a mother and a community leader, Reyes said that the increasing prices and economic failure in Puerto Rico –&nbsp; along with the continuous school closures – create a fear within her for the future generations of the island.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“There&#8217;s a possibility that when my kid is in his 20s, most people are going to speak English here — not Spanish because of the change in the population,” she said. “And he&#8217;s going to be speaking a second language to be able to get around here.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People just like Reyes all over the island are now in the midst of reclaiming these abandoned school buildings and rebirthing them as community centers. The spaces are used to continue teaching individuals and foster a place for learning, even if it looks a little different than how the traditional school once did.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a town on the northeast part of the island called Luquillo,&nbsp; El Centro Cultural Multidisciplinario del Barrio Juan Martin is housed within the old Carolina G. de Veve Elementary School that closed in 2014.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Board of the center and a team of volunteers have been working to transform the school into an educational space that hosts artistic workshops and informational sessions about the local turtle populations, along with health clinics, food drives and caretaker instruction courses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although this center is still working toward getting the deed to the building, its members have been meeting and planning for the future.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The community has to be educated so that it knows where to go, what alliances to form with others, how to create communities like La Goyco, which is very well-organized with other organizations. Here, we have to have a community. Those alliances are what make us stronger,”<strong><em> </em></strong>said Castilian King, the secretary of the center.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><div

event.\n\n</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For many of these community center leaders, the ability to have a physical space that brings people to convene and learn is a key factor in keeping a community alive. By finding a way to be together in a common space, they believe that it works as a possibility for rebuilding hope and creating deeper ties with surrounding neighbors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Having a space as a community to come and gather, and have fun, and talk and vent is the first step toward the possibility of an organization that is solid and that is capable of transforming the way we live in the city in general,” Reyes said. “So I think it is a cultural anchor in the sense that it is a place where we gather many things that bring us together as a community.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reyes, the other leaders of La Goyco and other community center leaders all over the island have fruitful visions of the future, but these plans depend on funding.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some programs start with sole volunteer work and donations, while others receive approval for funding through government or private grants. La Goyco specifically is funded by a myriad of sources, including a group of businesses that rent spaces in the building. The numerous spaces — which include a print shop, recording booth and art studio — work to further increase the unique identities that flow in and out of the space each day.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, The Puerto Rico Fiscal Agency and Financial Advisory Authority, the agency that deals with financials in regard to infrastructure and rebuilding, granted the center a $100,000 fund to dedicate toward rebuilding and structural purposes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While this grant covers expenses related to the building, money is still needed to pay salaries and sponsor events. And while Reyes and Matos had previously worked without pay, she now has a salary because of a grant she had secretly submitted.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She had found a grant opportunity for artists that paid a full annual salary and also included an annual stipend of $20,000 for special projects, and put forth Matos’ name without him knowing. She said that she knew he wouldn’t have submitted the grant application, so she went ahead and did it for him. After weeks of waiting, he was approved to receive the money to help fund the projects of La Goyco.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The approval came one day after his death.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"replace-gall\"> PHOTO XP </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reyes was still able to claim the award and continues to use that money to pay herself a salary and also fund La Goyco’s programs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After Matos’ death, the community center’s budget went from $100,000 to $1.7 million due to the community&#8217;s outpouring of money from people who wanted to ensure Tito and his legacy stayed alive in the center. However, these memorial donations are only given once, which means the majority of Reyes’ time is spent creating plans to find more money and continue sustaining the people within the center and all they do in the continuing years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, La Goyco and the rest of the centers are being built up to foster the community and beyond by providing a physical space for Puerto Ricans to be together in a time of healing and resistance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><div data-gatsby-image-wrapper=\"\"
