On the dashboard a mini hula girl swayed her hips to the rhythm of the bumpy gravel driveway. It’s Thursday — the biggest day of the week for the clinical psychologist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s when Intercambios Puerto Rico, the organization that Román works for, embarks on its weekly journey to provide free primary care and mental health services to people who otherwise wouldn’t have the resources to seek treatment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intercambios is headquartered in Fajardo, a beach town of just over 11,000 nestled into the northeast corner of the island. Most of the people that Intercambios works with are impoverished. Many are homeless, chronic drug users — or both.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the mainland U.S., Puerto Rico is dealing with the consequences of the fentanyl crisis. The island’s health care system, which has become strained as a result of a tattered economy and destruction wrought by Hurricane Maria, cannot provide care to the people who need it most. NGOs, like Intercambios, can help fill those gaps in service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"replace-video\" id=\"health-vid\">Video loading&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Intercambios team includes two clinical psychologists, a nurse, a case manager, program coordinators and several outreach workers. They were waiting by a large black RV when Román arrived.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The organization’s logo, a bright yellow stethoscope protruding out of a cyclone, is emblazoned on the side of the vehicle. There’s also a phone number and a listed mission statement: <em>harm reduction, HIV prevention, mental health and substance abuse counseling</em>. Inside, the RV resembles a typical doctor’s office that could be found in any brick-and-mortar clinic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each Thursday, Román and several of his coworkers take the RV around the eastern part of the island as part of Intercambios’s “La Móvil” program. The organization also has a syringe exchange program that works alongside the “La Móvil”<em> </em>RV on its weekly journeys.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the team prepared the RV, Frederick Cortés, the coordinator of the Intercambios syringe exchange program, packed supplies into a black Ford Transit van for the day’s trip.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A five-gallon water cooler sat on the back seat. Three plastic storage boxes were stacked in the back. One with clean syringes. The second with mini cookers and alcohol prep pads. The third with naloxone nasal spray, an overdose reversal medication.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to providing care for chronic drug users, Intercambios practices a policy of harm reduction. In contrast to abstinence-based treatment, harm reduction focuses on mitigating risk when it comes to drug use. Advocates say providing clean syringes and education on safer drug practices can help reduce overdoses and the spread of HIV and Hepatitis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“What’s most important is ‘How do we keep this person alive right now?’” Cortés explained.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Approximately a quarter after 9 a.m,. the caravan rolled out of the lot. The RV headed 20 miles south to Humacao. The syringe exchange crew in the black van drove slightly further down the coast to the town of Yabucoa.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><div data-gatsby-image-wrapper=\"\"

territory status, the island serves as a key transshipment point for drugs destined for the mainland U.S. If cartels from South America and Mexico can get their product onto the island, they can more easily smuggle it into the states without dealing with customs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to José Antonio Vargas Vidot, a member of the Puerto Rican Senate and former physician, about 140,000 people are problematic drug users on the island of just over three million. Overdoses have skyrocketed in the past several years, but there are limited resources to treat addiction. Those who survive overdoses are typically sent right back out to the street.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It’s like a revolving door,” Vidot said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carmen Albizu-García, a mental health and substance use disorders researcher at the University of Puerto Rico, said most overdoses on the island are associated with fentanyl.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fentanyl has been popular since the 1990s for treating chronic pain patients, but the drug has flooded into the black market over the past decade, mostly coming from China and Mexico. It’s an appealing substance for cartels, who can manufacture the synthetic opioid for far cheaper than plant-based heroin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dealers also like fentanyl because of its incredible potency, up to 50 times stronger than heroin. Just a tiny amount can be cut into other common street drugs – heroin, cocaine and pills – to simulate the same euphoric effects for cheap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“There&#8217;s always market adaptation, and the drug market has a lot of resources,” Albizu-García said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fentanyl’s potency makes it incredibly risky for drug users, particularly those who may not realize they are ingesting it.</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"replace-interactive\" id=\"fent\">This better be replaced</span>\n\n\n\n<p>The overdose numbers are reflecting the consequences of the fentanyl boom. Albizu-García said that data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pointed to a 27-fold increase of opioid deaths from 2017 — the year that Hurricane Maria devastated the Caribbean — to 2021, the most recent year for which data is available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maria killed nearly 3,000 Puerto Ricans and caused $90 billion in damage. It was also around the time that fentanyl first started to appear on the island.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People who lost their jobs and homes to the storm were more likely to start using drugs, said Jesús Sálamo, another clinical psychologist at Intercambios. The toll that Maria and then COVID-19 had on mental health also exacerbated the opioid problem in Puerto Rico.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The mental health crisis that Maria (made) impacts directly in the use of drugs,” said Sálamo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those who could no longer access service from a health care system that became stretched too thin amid a shortage of funding and doctors began to look to the streets to find their medication.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Intercambios workers say that they have witnessed the effects of the fentanyl crisis out in the field. It makes their work more difficult, as drug users who have been injecting for years are suddenly losing their lives at the hands of accidental overdoses. It also makes Intercambios’s work all the more important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A trio of men were already waiting for the black syringe exchange van when it pulled up to its usual street corner in Yabucoa. The oldest among them, a man in his late 50s, ran up with a smile and greeted the outreach workers. Once the van parked, he grabbed a folding table out of the back to help the team set up on their corner. It’s become a weekly routine for him at this point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The man answered some questions from an outreach worker who jotted his answers down on a receipt. It was basic information — age, years using injection drugs, how frequently they use drugs. Intercambios doesn’t collect names, just a first and last initial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We focus on providing what are called low threshold services,” Cortés said. “So that means basically having the least amount of obstacles in the person&#8217;s way, or requirements, for them to access care. So I don&#8217;t need to know their real name to be able to provide a syringe.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The man took his bag of supplies, thanked the workers and left.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That interaction was the busiest it got that day for the crew in Yabucoa. The southern town of fewer than 6,500 people is where Maria first made landfall nearly six years ago, and the community is still reeling from the devastation of the storm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was noticeably quiet that Thursday morning. Cortés, sitting legs crossed on the pavement, cut through the silence by plucking a few tunes on his cuatro. The small, guitar-like instrument is an iconic component of the island’s musical history. He played songs out of a tab book of Puerto Rican music. At 11 a.m., the church bells rang, signaling it was time for the group to pack up and move on to the next checkpoint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"replace-gall\"> Photo XP </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Years of drug rehabilitation research show that prescription medication is the most effective treatment for opioid use disorder. The two primary treatments are methadone and buprenorphine, both of which are opioid class drugs themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Methadone, the oldest and most common of the two treatments, is ingested orally in the form of a fruit-flavored drink. Buprenorphine can come in the form of a pill or strip that’s placed on the tongue. They are opioid agonists, meaning that they can curb cravings and stop withdrawal symptoms when used properly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Patients seeking methadone treatment must take it multiple times a week at designated treatment centers, of which there are only six in Puerto Rico. The system operates under a strict set of rules because methadone is a controlled substance regulated by the Drug Enforcement Administration. If a patient misses an appointment they may be booted from the program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of these hurdles, it can be extremely difficult for chronic drug users to access treatment, particularly within the impoverished population that Intercambios primarily works with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The clinic is working to get the DEA license required to provide Suboxone, the brand name for a combination of buprenorphine and naloxone. However, Intercambios only has one physician based out of California to provide telehealth services. One of the organization’s major goals is to hire an on-site physician to prescribe treatments for OUD.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem? There are not enough doctors and not enough money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For years, doctors have been leaving the island in droves to pursue better financial opportunities in the mainland U.S. Nearly half of Puerto Ricans rely on the island’s Medicaid program, which, as in all U.S. territories, is funded at a much lower rate compared to the 50 states.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The federal funding that Puerto Rico receives for Medicaid spending is capped at a 55 percent matching rate, despite its per capita income being over $10,000 less than that of Mississippi, the poorest U.S. state. The federal government matches Mississippi’s medicaid spending at an 84 percent rate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Puerto Rico has received sporadic, temporary increases in funding over the past several years thanks to the Families First Coronavirus Response Act of 2020 and the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2022. But that money ran out in December, plummeting Puerto Rico back down to its low matching rate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only will that change continue to affect the wages of healthcare workers, but it will also limit prescription drug services on the island.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intercambios can offer its services free of charge thanks to a grant from Direct Relief, a humanitarian aid organization. That grant stipulates that a physician at Intercambios would be paid $42 an hour, which, according to Sálamo, is far less than what doctors could make elsewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And even those limited resources provided by the grant won’t last after this year, Román said. Intercambios is in the process of negotiating a contract to get in network with Vital, the island’s Medicaid program. Getting that contract would help relieve the financial pressure that the clinic faces on a day-to-day basis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sálamo said that he picked up a moonlighting job with the Puerto Rico Department of Education to make ends meet. The 42-year-old supports three daughters and said he doesn’t earn enough at Intercambios to comfortably make ends meet.<br><br>Sálamo acknowledged that with his psychology degree he could be making much more money elsewhere, but he has no intention of walking away from his community clinic. The need is too great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“If I don’t do it, maybe no one else can do it,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the pay, Sálamo said he loves the work he does with Intercambios. He welcomes the pressure that comes with providing care in the streets. There’s an excitement to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In school he learned that a psychological intervention takes about 45 minutes to reach a breakthrough. Out in the field, he said, the job must be finished in the time it takes to smoke a cigarette.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The blazing sun sat high in the sky when the “La Móvil” crew reunited with the syringe exchange van in a suburban offshoot of Humacao, right outside the walls of a public housing project — the halfway point of the trip.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cortés and his crew set their syringe exchange station back up on the sidewalk. Meanwhile, Sálamo conducted some in-home visits nearby as Román attended to participants inside the RV clinic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Humacao was the busiest stop of the day as men and women, young and old, came to the mobile doctor’s office. Over the years, Intercambios has built up enough trust within the community, among both the drug users and drug dealers which hang around the area, to do its work largely unbothered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One man, Bautista, rode up on his bicycle and gave Román a warm greeting. Like the man from Yabucoa, Bautista is in his 50s and has used drugs for over 30 years. However, Bautista said he’s actively receiving buprenorphine treatment for his addiction, thanks in part to the weekly support he receives from Intercambios.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He still occasionally injects cocaine, but Bautista said he’s been off opioids for one year now. He’s also receiving counseling from Román and has found permanent housing, something he didn’t have the luxury of just a few years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, Bautista’s journey has been long and arduous. Cutting ties with the drug users he associates with has been one of the hardest lifestyle changes he’s had to make in his recovery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Every corner is the same,” he said with a wise grin and slight twinkle in his eye.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a check in with Román, Bautista thanked the Intercambios crew and rode off on his bike. His future isn’t certain, but it’s less bleak than it used to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Román and a few others break away to a local Japanese restaurant for a late-afternoon lunch. Most Thursdays, a group lunch is necessary for the team to de-escalate amid an intense work day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the break, there’s one last stop that Román and Intercambios nurse José Lozada need to make — a scheduled in-home visit in Naguabo with one of their patients. Joseph, a middle-aged drug user, was suffering from large skin ulcers on both of his forearms that have been caused by dangerous injection practices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Severe swelling made mobility an issue for Joseph. On the way to his house, Román said he worries that, if left untreated for too long, he may lose one or both of his arms to amputation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joseph was already getting into the driver’s seat of his pickup truck as the Intercambios van arrived. By the time Román got out to talk, it was already too late. Joseph explained he needed to drive his uncle to a separate medical appointment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There would be no treatment for the wounds on Joseph’s arms until at least the next week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“For today, we’ve lost Joseph,” Román said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By then, the sun had started to dip in the sky behind a wall of clouds. Román climbed back into the van and drove back into Fajardo to reconnect with the rest of his coworkers at the Intercambios clinic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a week’s time, the crew will do it all over again. The cycle repeats.</p>\n","title":"ROAD TO RECOVERY","date":"March 16, 2023","featuredImage":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDoyNQ==","previousPostId":"cG9zdDo1OA==","nextPostId":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["1693042298","848497233"],"slicesMap":{}}
