The barge, called the Ancón, was once the only way to get from the capital city of San Jaun to the island’s eastern coast. It was a major economic driver for Loíza, and the building housed a restaurant owned by María Luisa Cortijo, a matriarch of the town.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"/_gatsby/file/775bc468488de3d676e6e822ddb851f1/Lewis-03102023-FRI-129.jpg?u=http%3A%2F%2Fisladefuerza.unc.edu%2Fwp%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2023%2F04%2FLewis-03102023-FRI-129.jpg\" alt=\"A concrete building with a view of a bridge sits on the river.\" class=\"wp-image-158 inline-gatsby-image-wrapper\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The fishing dock, located in Loiza, Puerto Rico is connected to El Ancon, a community center that has become a pillar in the area. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Andres Santos, a lawyer and the executive director of the center, said many people used to take the Ancón across the river to access services in town or to get to school each day.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"/_gatsby/file/c2c100f220c99d872994001ac36fdf51/Lewis-03132023-MON-91.jpg?u=http%3A%2F%2Fisladefuerza.unc.edu%2Fwp%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2023%2F04%2FLewis-03132023-MON-91.jpg\" alt=\"A bridge sits over a river under a clear, blue sky.

Instead, they see them as direct results of government choices in which they have no say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I have seen in the vast majority of work that the communities can get together aside of the governmental structures,” Santos said. “Because the governments are a bad reflection of what we are.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a year before hurricanes Irma and Maria devastated the island that then-President Barack Obama signed the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act — widely known as PROMESA — which established the Financial Oversight and Management Board that now controls the entire budget of the Puerto Rican elected government.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The act was passed ostensibly to help Puerto Rico restructure what then-Gov. Alejandro García Padilla, called an “unpayable” public debt of more than $70 billion. The United States Government Accountability Office attributed this debt to annual deficits, borrowing to cover those deficits and the territory’s prolonged economic contraction. Others have attributed the debt to government corruption and financial mismanagement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though Puerto Rico is no longer legally bankrupt after a federal court confirmed a plan in 2022 to reduce the debt by 80%, the Board’s work also led to austerity measures like slashing funding for the University of Puerto Rico, closing more than 450 schools and reducing employee benefits previously mandated by the territory’s elected government.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Naming the act “PROMESA,” the spanish word for “promise,” felt like a slap in the face to Judith Berkan, a San Juan attorney who was recently involved in litigation about public records access against the Board.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<h4>&#8220;That&#8217;s not something that Congress could do with the state, put a board like this in place.&#8221; </h4>\n<cite>&#8211; David Skeel, chairperson of the Financial Management and Oversight Board</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>“It&#8217;s the most disgusting acronym,” she said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Board is composed of seven legal and economic experts appointed over the past eight years.

The Jones Act — which requires that goods transported between two American ports must be transported on ships flying U.S. flags — was passed in the wake of World War I to protect American shipbuilders and boost the maritime economy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The legislation prevents foreign goods from reaching Puerto Rico without accruing extra shipping costs along the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And not only do goods cost more, but sometimes they don’t even arrive.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"/_gatsby/file/8b59126837921e7c0b0830a55ed077be/Lewis-03132023-MON-156.jpg?u=http%3A%2F%2Fisladefuerza.unc.edu%2Fwp%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2023%2F04%2FLewis-03132023-MON-156.jpg\" alt=\"A close up horseshoe and stake sit atop a beige handmade net, surrounded by fishing gear.\" class=\"wp-image-180 inline-gatsby-image-wrapper\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">A horseshoe and stake sit atop a handmade net, one of Díaz’s many skills.

And that has practically happened with several hurricanes,” Díaz said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Citizens of the island don’t vote in federal elections. They are citizens of a United States territory, not a state, and territories don’t have voting representation in Congress or any representation in the Electoral College that elects the president.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“What we have here is rules from the federal government that we didn&#8217;t participate in choosing,” Santos said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So instead of waiting for government action, the directors of El Ancón are acting locally. They hope to reopen the barge as a tourist attraction, bring economic growth back to Loíza and encourage people to interact with the community’s history and identity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<h4>&#8220;If I have a seat and if I have food, then you and your loved ones will.
