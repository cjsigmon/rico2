The building has sat dormant for the last decade – up until now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year, the hotel was sold to The Ishay Group, a New York-based reality company, who plans to refurbish the hotel and lease some surrounding land from the city of San Juan. An advocacy group called <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/escambronunido\">Escambrón Unido</a> fears that plans for the hotel’s elevated swimming pool and parking lot would destroy a local park and limit public access to the beach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"replace-video\" id=\"env-vid\">Video loading&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Escambrón Unido is not opposed to the remodeling of the Normandie Hotel,” said <a href=\"https://es-us.finanzas.yahoo.com/noticias/activistas-puerto-rico-protestan-extensi%C3%B3n-203608195.html\">Gradissa Fernández</a>, an activist from Escambrón Unido. “We oppose the remodeling of the hotel being extended to an area that disposes of assets for public use and domain.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Miguel Romero, the mayor of San Juan, supports the project.

He also wants part of our beach.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the residents of San Juan, the park they take their grandkids to, the beach where they learned to surf, could be changed forever— for $460,000 a year.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"/_gatsby/file/a09aec26da045ad58cbdbebde04db1b5/20230313_Thiessen_FifthDay-238-scaled.jpg?u=http%3A%2F%2Fisladefuerza.unc.edu%2Fwp%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2023%2F04%2F20230313_Thiessen_FifthDay-238-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"A surfer walks into the water\" class=\"wp-image-469 inline-gatsby-image-wrapper\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">A local surfer walks out into the water at Escambron Beach.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“Our politicians, they don’t seem to really care,” said Enrique Paoli, a member of the nearby beach camp. “They’re just looking at commerce, money, and they do put aside the environment. That’s a serious problem. It’s happening all over.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the last two decades, the Puerto Rican government has passed a series of legislative measures that make it easier for foreign investors to develop on the island.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2009, the Government of Puerto Rico switched from a decentralized planning system to a centralized one. The creation of the Office of Permit Management (OGPE) meant that local representatives of the island’s 78 municipalities lost a lot of their control in the approval of new development. That control was now in the hands of a territory official.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;In March, Puerto Rico’s Supreme Court decided OGPE’s set of rules and requirements for how most permits are issued null and void, bringing 200,000 permits under question. Immediately following the ruling, however, <a href=\"https://www.sanjuandailystar.com/post/permits-still-in-force-despite-high-court-ruling-officials-say\">OGPE officials said they would continue to issue permits</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2012, the Puerto Rican government passed Acts 20 and 22. <a href=\"https://www.the2022actsociety.org/tax-incentives/act-20/\">Act 20</a> provides tax exemptions for businesses with an office located in Puerto Rico that export products or services to non-residents or foreign entities. <a href=\"https://relocatepuertorico.com/puerto-rico-tax-incentives-the-ultimate-guide-to-act-20-and-act-22/#:~:text=Puerto%20Rico%20Act%2022%20%E2%80%93%20The%20Individual%20Investors%20Act&amp;text=As%20long%20as%20an%20individual,to%20as%20high%20as%2037%25.\">Act 22</a> provides tax exemptions for residents who have relocated to Puerto Rico and whose income is sourced from the island. In 2020, these tax exemptions were adopted under Act 60 with slight modifications.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outside of San Juan, the municipality of Dorado is known for its beaches, although for many of the native Puerto Ricans, their access to the beach is eroding away. Many residents say the rapid onset of foreign investment has cut off much of the coast. While beaches in Puerto Rico have been legally protected against privatization efforts s<a href=\"https://www.liberationnews.org/the-fight-against-privatization-of-beaches-in-puerto-rico/\">ince 1979</a>, that doesn&#8217;t stop present-day developers from privatizing large masses of land against the coast, cutting off road access, and placing jagged rocks along the borders of their communities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We don’t have access to our land,” said Michelle Rodriguez-Olívero, a native Doradeña. “These people are doing whatever they want with our resources, and we just don’t know because they close the doors.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"/_gatsby/file/a3a451b16dc6dc7cf8f4d9cfc3d7ca00/20230312_Thiessen_FourthDay-1504-scaled.jpg?u=http%3A%2F%2Fisladefuerza.unc.edu%2Fwp%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2023%2F04%2F20230312_Thiessen_FourthDay-1504-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"People stand on the beach\" class=\"wp-image-467 inline-gatsby-image-wrapper\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">People enjoy the sun at Escambron Beach, only a short distance from the protest camp.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Rodriguez has been living in Higuillar, a coastal barrio of Dorado, for over three decades. She said the rapid increase in the cost of living, thanks to tourist and foreign investment, has forced many of the native residents out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The gentrification has made a lot of damage for local businesses – for our community,” Rodriguez said. “It has been a struggle to buy houses here, in the same neighborhood that we have been living in for four generations because of the prices. I’m here as a way of resistance.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, <a href=\"https://time.com/5955629/puerto-rico-tax-haven-opposition/\">Pedro Pierluisi</a>, the current governor of Puerto Rico, said Act 60 is critical to decreasing the territory’s unemployment rate and is part of an “effort to attract population and new investment.” In his first year in office, the approval of construction permits increased <a href=\"https://periodismoinvestigativo.com/2022/01/acelerada-construccion-costas-pedro-pierluisi/\">by 29%</a>, according to OGPE data analyzed by the Center of Investigative Journalism, based in Puerto Rico.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://time.com/5955629/puerto-rico-tax-haven-opposition/\">Pierluisi</a> denied that he and his family personally benefited from Act 60 – but his daughter-in-law, Blanca Hebe Lopez Pierluisi, is a luxury real estate agent and admin of a Facebook Group titled “<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/136843803582457/\">Act 20/22 PR Real Estate Guide.</a>” Hebe’s agent site also says she participated in the “<a href=\"https://www.corcoran.com/real-estate-agents/detail/blanca-hebe-lopez-pierluisi/114280/regionId/118\">launching</a>” of the Ritz-Carlton Reserve Residences in Dorado, where a<a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Residences+at+Dorado+Beach,+a+Ritz-Carlton+Reserve/@18.475285,-66.301028,15z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x8c031389bf722df3:0x75e30ffb0a8cec7b!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d18.475285!4d-66.301028!16s%2Fg%2F11gbl36qnm\"> single night’s</a> stay can cost almost half the<a href=\"https://namecensus.com/demographics/puerto-rico/lajas-municipio/maguayo/\"> average annual household income</a> of an inland Doradeño.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past decade, Puerto Rico’s new legislation has brought in billions of dollars’ worth of foreign investment, but a lack of revenue to support infrastructure and social services for its native residents.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<h4>&#8220;I’m here as a way of resistance&#8221;</h4>\n<cite>&#8211; Michelle Rodriguez-Olívero, a native Doradeña</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>On the mountainous end of Dorado, at the border between Higuillar and Maguayo, Elise Sanchez-Salgado and her husband, Juan Rivera Torres live in a house on a broken channel. They are part of a larger lower-income community that’s been struggling with flooding since 2007.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That year, the Puerto Rican government shut down a part of a two-pronged channel, thereby directing a storm-surge into Sanchez’s neighborhood. According to staff from the <a href=\"https://advance-lexis-com.libproxy.lib.unc.edu/document/?pdmfid=1516831&amp;crid=7c9275bf-a5fd-4ac1-b2d6-988e72553247&amp;pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fnews%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A7YMT-S4V0-YBKJ-B544-00000-00&amp;pdcontentcomponentid=323553&amp;pdteaserkey=sr10&amp;pditab=allpods&amp;ecomp=zznyk&amp;earg=sr10&amp;prid=94036638-2933-4069-b383-644756cff580\">Federal Emergency Management Agency</a>, the channel was “not completed to prevent various flat sectors and neighborhoods from being flooded.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/locales/notas/lluvias-incomunican-dos-escuelas/\">September 2011</a>, rescue teams saved students from the neighborhood&#8217;s middle school, Marcelino Canino Canino, after heavy rains trapped them inside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.primerahora.com/noticias/puerto-rico/notas/mas-de-40-familias-perdieron-sus-pertenencias-por-las-inundaciones-en-dorado/\">February 2022</a>, around 45 families lost their belongings in another storm. The floodwaters were so high that residents ran out of their homes in raincoats to prevent their cars from being carried away.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On February 12, 2023, another storm resulted in nearly two feet of flooding, according to residents. Video provided by residents shows bits of broken furniture piled against a metal fence, sticking out of the brown floodwater like spikes. Another video shows flood waters knocking a man over and dragging him past a parked gray sedan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To permanently fix the channeling, it would cost the Puerto Rican Highway and Transportation Authority <a href=\"https://esnoticiapr.com/tag/chorro-de-maguayo/\">$745,000</a> – but representatives of the agency said they don’t have the money. While the National Guard has $600,000 allocated for mitigation related to the project, they can’t use it until a ramp is in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“There’s no way of defining it,” Sanchez said. “I know these are things of nature, but we can try to fix the impact. [&#8230;] They just don’t care for the poor.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sanchez and her community’s situation is further exacerbated by floodgates upstream along the Rio De La Plata. When the gates release water, it flows down the river, and directly into the broken channel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few mornings after Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, Sanchez was sitting on the porch of her home when she saw water begin to barrel down her street. Before she knew it, the water was up to her throat, she said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I thought I was going to die,” she said. “I was screaming to my husband, ‘Get me out! Get me out!’”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"/_gatsby/file/3bb051e62d14ada94f55bbf92e554662/202304_Holbrooks_MaguayoFlooding-1-2-scaled.jpg?u=http%3A%2F%2Fisladefuerza.unc.edu%2Fwp%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2023%2F04%2F202304_Holbrooks_MaguayoFlooding-1-2-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"A woman stands in a doorway pointing at the wall\" class=\"wp-image-471 inline-gatsby-image-wrapper\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Elise Sanchez-Salgado shows how high the floodwater came into her home during Hurricane Maria.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the end, roughly four feet of water poured into Sanchez’s home and destroyed nearly all of her furniture and clothes. While she and her husband were able to rebuild using donations from their church and $4,000 in recovery aid provided by FEMA, subsequent storms have repeatedly taken what little they have left, she said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I still take pills for my nerves because that has left me sick,” Sanchez said. “I’ve lost everything.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To address the flooding in Dorado, the U.S. Army Corps has begun a $<a href=\"https://www.saj.usace.army.mil/RiodeLaPlata/\">500 million project along</a> the Rio De La Plata. So far, the only part of the project that has been completed is Contract #1 – which in addition to bulldozing through an <a href=\"https://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/locales/notas/usace-defiende-trabajos-en-yacimiento-de-dorado/\">ancestral site</a>, coincides with the increase in rental prices closer to the coast.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<h4>“I know these are things of nature, but we can try to fix the impact.&#8221; </h4>\n<cite>&#8211; Elise Sanchez-Salgado a resident of Maguayo</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>While the USACE plans to build a canal straight through wetlands near Sanchez’s neighborhood, it makes no note of the channel. The USACE removed a section of the project that would prevent flooding for residents of Toa Alta, another upstream primarily lower-income community that also suffers from frequent flooding.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"replace-coast\">Loading Interactive . . . </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I don&#8217;t think the real problem is the floods,” Rodriguez said. “I think it&#8217;s the conditions that Puerto Ricans are living – our necessities are not attended. So we have to find another place of living with a better quality for life.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since <a href=\"https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/PRI/puerto-rico/population\">2001</a>, Puerto Rico’s population has declined. After Hurricane Maria, more than <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/puerto-rico-us-territory-crisis\">130,000 </a>Puerto Ricans fled to the continental United States. Today, more people o<a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/puerto-rico-us-territory-crisis\">f Puerto Rican descent live in the mainland</a> U.S. than on the island. A 2019 study projected that Puerto Rico’s population would decrease by <a href=\"https://www.aafaf.pr.gov/assets/fiscal-plan-pr-fy2020-draft-03-10-2019.pdf\">8</a>% by 2024, and the effects of Hurricane Fiona may push out even more residents in the coming years.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"/_gatsby/file/e7425481ae88d498da54276cfa3bf589/20230310_Thiessen_Drone-626-scaled.jpg?u=http%3A%2F%2Fisladefuerza.unc.edu%2Fwp%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2023%2F04%2F20230310_Thiessen_Drone-626-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"The sun sets on the coast\" class=\"wp-image-465 inline-gatsby-image-wrapper\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The sun sets on development in Vega Baja.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“Puerto Rico without Puerto Ricans is already happening,” said Ricardo Laureano, a resident of Vega Baja. “When they besiege you so much, the time comes when people start to get frustrated and weaken and leave. When my children were young, I thought of going to New Zealand. In the end, we decided to stay.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laureano is the founder of Grupo V.I.D.A.S., an advocacy group that specializes in coastal revitalization and sustainable development. Grupo V.I.D.A.S was started in 2006 as a direct response to local concerns that a developer may privatize the Vega Baja coast. Since then the organization has been working to prevent environmental injustice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We decided to do the damn thing,” he said. “The Little War. A lot of quarrels. A lot of lawsuits about small fines, but lawsuits that stopped [developers]. This coastal area is the only space that remains free.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Grupo V.I.D.A.S has grown a lot since its creation. The organization now has over <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/139894882692230/\">1,400 members</a> on Facebook and are headquartered in a small school. They are working to create a makeshift laboratory where they intend to revitalize part of a coral reef.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The barrier, which should have been a reserve a lot of years ago and hasn&#8217;t been designated, we have been working on it,” Laureano said. “We have plans to create corals in tanks in a simulated ecosystem and then carry out transplants there.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, Grupo V.I.D.A.S is working to protect the coastline by getting undeveloped lands documented as reserve sites. In Satrapas, Grupo V.I.D.A.S hung up painted signs made by local kids to dissuade developers from buying up the beach. They’ve also begun to petition to keep the home for endangered species and surfers alike.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<h4>“Puerto Rico without Puerto Ricans is already happening” </h4>\n<cite>&#8211; Ricardo Laureano, a resident of Vega Baja</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the residents of Dorado and San Juan who refuse to be displaced, Grupo V.I.D.A.S is a community fighting for the possession of its own resources and environmental equality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s an uphill battle.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But to many of the residents of Puerto Rico, it’s one worth fighting for.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“And that&#8217;s how we are going,” Laureano said. “Punching them little by little. You delay and in delaying, you train a community to defend itself. You raise their pride – they can win and they just have to.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"/_gatsby/file/56dd576dfed52dda9307f34730d673ef/20230314_Thiessen_SixthDayDrone-451-scaled.jpg?u=http%3A%2F%2Fisladefuerza.unc.edu%2Fwp%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2023%2F04%2F20230314_Thiessen_SixthDayDrone-451-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"The sun sets on the beach protest camp\" class=\"wp-image-463 inline-gatsby-image-wrapper\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The sun sets on Escambron Beach.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n","title":"SHIFTING TIDES","date":"April 07, 2023","featuredImage":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDoxMDk=","previousPostId":"cG9zdDoxMTQ=","nextPostId":"cG9zdDo1OA=="}},"staticQueryHashes":["1693042298","848497233"],"slicesMap":{}}
